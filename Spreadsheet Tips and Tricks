But, like most tools we have covered in this course, the best way to learn is to practice. This was just a small taste of what you can do with pivot tables, but the more you work with pivot tables, the more you will discover.  

Below is a list of resources that can inspire your next data-driven decisions, as well as teach you how to make your data more accessible to your audience:
* The data visualization catalogue: Not sure where to start with data visualization?

Engage your audience
Remember: an important component of being a data analyst is the ability to communicate your findings in a way that will appeal to your audience. Data visualization has the ability to make complex (and even monotonous) information easily understood, and knowing how to utilize data visualization is a valuable skill to have. Your goal is always to help the audience have a conversation with the data so your visuals draw them into the conversation. This is especially true when you have to help your audience engage with a large amount of data, such as the flow of goods from one country to other parts of the world.

* Correlation in statistics is the measure of the degree to which two variables move in relationship to each other. An example of correlation is the idea that “As the temperature goes up, ice cream sales also go up.” It is important to remember that correlation doesn’t mean that one event causes another. But, it does indicate that they have a pattern with or a relationship to each other. If one variable goes up and the other variable also goes up, it is a positive correlation. If one variable goes up and the other variable goes down, it is a negative or inverse correlation. If one variable goes up and the other variable stays about the same, there is no correlation.
* Causation refers to the idea that an event leads to a specific outcome. For example, when lightning strikes, we hear the thunder (sound wave) caused by the air heating and cooling from the lightning strike. Lightning causes thunder. 

if there is a correlation between two variables, a pattern will be seen when the variables are plotted on a scatterplot.
There are three ways to describe the correlation between variables.
* 		Positive correlation: As xxx increases yyy increases
* 		Negative correlation: As xxx increases yyy decreases
* 		No correlation: As xxx increases yyy stays same and has no clear pattern  stays about the same or has no clear pattern.
Causation can only be determined from an appropriately designed experiment.
* 		Sometimes when two variables are correlated, the relationship is coincidental or a third factor is causing them both to change.
